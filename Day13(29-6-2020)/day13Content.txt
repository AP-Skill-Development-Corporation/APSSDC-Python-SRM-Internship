Good morning all:
-------------------------
---> python is also support object oriented program
    -->class
    -->object
    -->method
    -->constructor
    -->inheritance
    -->packages and modules

    --->class:
            it is collection of varibles and method
            syntax:
                class class_name:
                    a,b=3,4

                    def add():
                        return 5+8
                    def sub():
                        return 5-3
                    def mul():
                        return 4*5
            -->for accessing variables and methods we have to class_name
            -->class name should starts with caps
    -->Object:
        -- it is instance of a class
        syntax:
            objectName = className
            or
            objectName = className()
    -->constructor:
        -->without using object we have to call a method that means
        while creating object only it will call a method
        --> for creating that constructos we have to use a special mmethod
            __init__(self)
        -->we are using cons here to make dynamic apps
