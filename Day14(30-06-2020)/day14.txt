Good morning all:
-------------------------
    ==>Packages and modules:
        -->here we are splitting a lorge program into sub programs
        -->Package:
            -->it is a folder
            -->in that packages we will keep modules
        -->Module:
            -->it is .py file
        --Accessing packages:
            --> for this we have to use a keyword 'import'
                -->if my modules is existed in same location(controller and modules)
                    --> import directly
                -->otherwise, if modules existed in a folder
                    --> here we have to use a special keyword 'from'
        task1:
            -->you can create a new module with name 'math2', in that you have to
            create few functions for finding even num,odd num and prim num.

        we have 2 different types of  modules:
            -->default modules
                ex:numpy,pandas,matplotlib,re,request,json,keywords,os,math,array
            --> user defined modules
                ex:math1,math2

        --> for implementing modules we have 2 diff ways:
                -- using functions
                -- using opps
    Inheritance:
    ----------------
        --> inheriting properties from parent to child
